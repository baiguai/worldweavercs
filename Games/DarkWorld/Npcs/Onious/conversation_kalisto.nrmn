Oh great!
My superiors have been hearing rumors of undead activity throughout the land.
This is very troubling. Unfortunately we lack the resources necessary to deal with this issue.
However an adventurer like yourself could prove very useful to us.
Do you accept our offer? If so, I can provide you with further details.

She beckons you to her table. You follow her and sit down. A tall hooded man with a long staff
silently approaches and sits next to the cleric woman.
"My name is Onious." She informs you.
She drops a coin purse onto the table.
"Here's 100 gold pieces. At the conclusion of the mission I will give you much more than that."

We have arranged a room for you. Our journey will begin in the morning. In the meantime, feel
free to explore Kalisto. When you are ready to slumber for the night come back here, the rooms
are upstairs and your particular room is 204.

I'm sorry to hear that. Cheers.
