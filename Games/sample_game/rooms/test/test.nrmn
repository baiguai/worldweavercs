To use this test, you need to be in the home room, then activate the admin tools (See the Admin Help file).
Then you will need to record a macro (_recordon <name>) that issues a 'tests room' call then a 'look' command.
Stop the macro recording with a _recordend call.
Return to the home room.
Run that macro in test mode using:
_macro! <test name>
        }
