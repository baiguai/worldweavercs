Any element can have a syntax value, however it is only used in certain
situations. For example elements of the type input use syntax to allow the
player to interact with the game. And weapon elements use this field to allow
the player to arm themselves with one of the weapons they are carrying.

It is also used to attack specific enemies or specify specific objects in the
game.

The values stored in the syntax field are Regular Expressions (regex).
Regex expressions are extremely powerful, but difficult to master. They are
used to match the player's input with the value of the syntax field.

To help with game development there is a help topic that lists some example
regex values. You can use these to help craft your own syntax values.

To view this help topic use:
