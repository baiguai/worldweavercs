Everything in a WorldWeaver game is made up of Elements. Every Element has a common set of potential properties.
How Elements are processed by WorldWeaver can be altered by modifying its core configuration files.

Even the Help System can be altered as needed by modifying the .json files within the ./Help/General directory.

And the logic that is applied to various Elments can be extended using Logic type Elements in conjunction with
Tags and other properties.


To begin learning about building games in WorldWeaver, you can explore the Elements help topic, or view some of
the provided Samples.
