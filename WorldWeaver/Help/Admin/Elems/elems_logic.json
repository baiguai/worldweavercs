Any element can have a value in its logic field. However there is a dedicated
logic element type. A dedicated logic type uses the logic field to perform
complex comparison logic.

To utilize this logic you will create an 'auto line break' multiline value:

{@
...
}

To set that logic block as a comparison, simply define an entry with a leading
question mark (?). To perform a second or third (or more) comparison, create
a row of 'and'.
(See the example above)
