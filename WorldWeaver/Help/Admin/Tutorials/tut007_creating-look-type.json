WorldWeaver (WW) allows game makers to define whatever element types they want. And those elements can
be called using action elements. Because of this you - as a game builder - aren't stuck using pre-defined
actions, or syntax, etc. You can do whatever you want with your game. Some Interactive Fiction (IF) engines
force you to use compass directions for moving around in the game. In WW you can do whatever you want.
It requires a bit more work on your end, but the concise nature of the scripting language (nrmn) is uses
is designed to help mitigate this potential drawback.

Let's define a look element in our local_pub file:

---

{key=local_pub, name=Local Pub, type=room, parent=root
    {type=enter_message
        output={@
You are sitting in your local pub.
        }
    }

    {type=look
        {type=message
            output={@
You look around the local pub.
North of where you are sitting is a small door.
            }
        }
    }
}

---

In this look element you can see there's an element with a type of 'message'.
These are special element types that are handled in their own way. We will discuss
this in future topics.

You'll notice that there is an @ symbol after the opening curly bracket. This means
that whenever you start a new line of text, that's how it will be shown in the game's
output. We will talk about that more in the future.

Now that we have a look element we need to allow the player to call that element.

So let's create our first action element.

            "links" : [
                "_help tut creating an action element"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
