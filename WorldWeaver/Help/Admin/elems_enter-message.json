Enter Messages are a special type of message element. They are called when
the player enters a new room. They can also be called via an action, so
you can allow the player to see them again if needed.

I like to create 'story' inputs that call the enter_message.
I usually make the enter_messages the story telling messages, providing
story details. And define look messages to serve a location
description role.
