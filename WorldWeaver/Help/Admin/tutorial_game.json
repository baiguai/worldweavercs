Let's create a WorldWeaver game.

Navigate to ~/GameSources and create a folder called MyGame. 'MyGame' is the name of your new game.
So to build it you would use _buildgame MyGame.

And when players want to play your game, they would use:
play MyGame


(NOTE:
When building or playing games the game (Folder) name is case sensitive.)

In this new folder we want to define our new game.
Create a file called game.nrmn.
You can name this file whatever you want (It must have an 'nrmn' extension, ALL game definition files must have an extension of 'nrmn'),
but ONE of your files must contain an element of a type set to 'game'.
There can be only one game element in your game's code. If you define more than one WorldWeaver will simply load the first one
it encounters in the database.
There can be other element types in the file, but the cleanest way to define your game is with a file dedicated to the game element.

Everything is an element and that includes the game itself. So in this file we'll define our game.
To define a game we'll create a new element with a type of 'game':

{key=game, name=My Game, type=game, parent=root
    ...
}

!NOTE!
When an element's parameters are defined on a single line, they are separated by a comma.
If you want to use multiple lines instead, you would use linebreaks. Like below:

{key=game
    name=My Game
    type=game
    parent=root
        ...
}

Be sure to read through the notes on debugging:
_help debugging

Notice that no commas are used when parameters are defined on multiple lines.

This also pertains to child elements.
Separate them by a line break, NOT a comma.

Next we'll define the Player.
