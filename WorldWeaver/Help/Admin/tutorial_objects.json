In the last article, this is what our room looked like:


{key=local_pub, name=Local Pub, type=room, parent=root
    {type=enter_message
        output={@
You are sitting in your local pub.
        }
    }


    {type=look, repeat=repeat
        {type=message
            output={@
You look around the local pub.
North of where you are sitting is a small door.
            }
        }
        {type=message
            output={@
You look around the local pub again...
North of where you are sitting is a small door.
            }
        }
    }



    {type=input, syntax=\b(look|l)\b
        {type=action, logic=look, tags=type }
    }
}


Now we're going to create an object that is sitting in the room.
We can define this object within the room's file or in its own file.
I like to keep code small, so let's create the object in its own file.

Create or Open:
~/GameSources/MyGame/Locations/Home/LocalPub/objects.nrmn
