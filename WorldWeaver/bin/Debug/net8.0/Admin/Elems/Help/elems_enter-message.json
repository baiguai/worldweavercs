You are sitting in your local pub.
A minstrel is playing music on a make-shift stage at the far end of the smokey room.
The pub is full of patrons talking loudly amongst themselves. It is an unruly raucous crowd this evening.

Enter Messages are a special type of message element. They are called when
the player enters a new room. They can also be called via an action, so
you can allow the player to see them again if needed.

I like to create 'story' inputs that call the enter_message.
I usually make the enter_messages the story telling messages, providing
story details. And define look messages to serve a location
description role.
