Various aspects of WorldWeaver (WW) can be modified simply but modifying
various configuration files. Various WW commands can be tweaked. They DO
rely on defined methods that they will call however so new ones cannot
be created without modifying the code itself. But their syntax can be changed
as you see fit.
These settings are located in:
~/Config/Commands/*


Element Processing
This is an extremely powerful configuration file. It not only tells WW which
order to process various elements in, but what elements to process and what
child elements each element can have.

If you find that WW isn't processing your game's elements as it should, you
can modify this config file. (It's good to make a backup before editing it
because this is such a core configuration. It is located here:

~/Config/ElementProcRules/ElementByType.json

You can also use this configuration file as a sort of 'lookup' reference
when you are defining your games.

In the elements help topics, the examples there assume the default rules that
are defined in the ElmentByType config.


* _help app settings
* _help init settings
* _help logic operands
* _help non message parent types
* _help repeat types
* _help self types
* _help static repeat types
