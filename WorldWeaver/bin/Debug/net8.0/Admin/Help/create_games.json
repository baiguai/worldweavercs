WorldWeaver games are defined using the Nrmn mark up language. This mark up was created specifically for WorldWeaver and is intended to be as concise as possible.
The best way to learn Nrmn is to look at some sample code (See _help nrmn).

!NOTE!
Pay close attention to when commas are and aren't used. This can cause unforseen issues when compiling WorldWeaver games (See _help debugging).


To create a new game, create a directory within:
~/GameSources

!NOTE!
The directory name you choose is the name of your game and it IS case sensitive. For example, the included sample game has a folder called 'DarkWorld'.
This is how the game is referred to. For example when building it you would use:
_buildgame DarkWorld

Everything in a WorldWeaver game is an element. If you are en experienced WorldWeaver game developer you can use the following to look up element types etc:
_help elements

If you are new to WorldWeaver use:
