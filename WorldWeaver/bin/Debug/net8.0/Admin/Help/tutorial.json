Let's create a WorldWeaver game.

Navigate to ~/GameSources and create a folder called MyGame. 'MyGame' is the name of your new game.
So to build it you would use _buildgame MyGame.

(NOTE:
When building or playing games the game (Folder) name is case sensitive.)

In this new folder we want to define our new game.
Create a file called game.nrmn.
You can name this file whatever you want, but ONE of your files must contain an element of a type set to 'game'.
There can be other element types in the file, but the cleanest way to define your game is with a file dedicated to the game element.

Everything is an element and that includes the game itself. So in this file we'll define our game.
To define a game we'll create a new element with a type of 'game':

{key=game, name=My Game, type=game, parent=root
    ...
}

!NOTE!
When an element's parameters are defined on a single line, they are separated by a comma.
If you want to use multiple lines instead, you would use linebreaks intead. Like below:

{key=game
    name=My Game
    type=game
    parent=root
        ...
}

Notice that no commas are used when parameters are defined on multiple lines.

Next we'll define the Player.
