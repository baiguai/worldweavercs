Input elements allow the game's player to interact with the game. What that
input does is up to you as the game's designer. Here is an example of an
input and the action it takes when the player's input matches the input's
syntax regular expression:

So in this example if the player types look or simply l the game will
process the look element in the room AND activate a non player character's
(NPC) travel element (See _help travel element).
