Global elements allow the game designer to define elements that can be called
regardless of the player's current location. There can be more than one
global entity in a game's definition files. These files are where you will
define the input the user will enter for listing their inventory or stats,
or any other game-wide information.

You can even use global elements to show is it day or night strings.
Consider the example below:

---

This file defines the input required for listing the user's inventory, stats,
and arming a weapon, as well as day/night messages.

Any input or custom element type you want to have accessible to the player
regardless of where they are should go in a global type element.


For a growing list of global entity examples use:
_help global examples
",
            "links" : [
                "_help ex global examples"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
