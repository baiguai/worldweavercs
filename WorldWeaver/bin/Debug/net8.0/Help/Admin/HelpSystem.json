Here is a template that you can use for building your own Help topics (Note that 'help' does not need to be added to the start of 'pattern'):

{
    \"topics\" : [
        {
            \"pattern\" : \"\\b(some topic)\\b\",
            \"title\" : \"Some Topic\",
            \"string\" : \"
Topic content here...
\",
            \"links\" : [
                \"help related topic\",
                \"help another topic\"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
