Sometimes we want to allow the player to enter syntax that can be matched regardless
of what room they are in. This can be done by creating an element of type 'global'.
Our player element has some attributes with a tag set to 'stats':

---

{key=player, name=, type=player, parent=local_pub
    {key=player_life, name=Life, type=attribute, output=[rand:8|18], tags=stats }
    {key=player_strength, name=Strength, type=attribute, output=[rand:8|18], tags=stats }
    {key=player_intelligence, name=Intelligence, type=attribute, output=[rand:8|18], tags=stats }
    {key=player_cunning, name=Cunning, type=attribute, output=[rand:8|18], tags=stats }
    {key=player_gold, name=Gold, type=attribute, output=[rand:20|40], tags=stats }
    {key=player_armed, name=Armed Weapon, type=attribute, output=, tags=armed|stats }

    {key=longsword_01, name=Long Sword, type=weapon, syntax=\b(long sword)\b, tags=inventory
        {name=Damage, type=attribute, logic=[rand:4|12], tags=damage }
    }
}

---

We want our players to be able to see what these stats are. So let's create a global file:

~/GameSources/ShadowKeep/global.nrmn

!NOTE!
    You can have more than one 'global' element in your game, so maybe you want to name this file
    global_player.nrmn
    That's entirely up to you.

Let's allow the player to view their stats.
