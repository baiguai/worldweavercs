Random values can be stored in an element's output (Typically attributes where
the random value is all that is stored there. When a random value is
assigned to an output the value is determined when a new game is started.
This means that every time the game is played these values are different.

You can use random values like this to store stats on characters or even
cause the game to be completely different every time it's played, using
logic and other elements.

Random values can also be stored in the logic field of an element. When they
are stored here, the value is set every time the element is called.

You can use random logic values for things like the amount of damage a weapon
inflicts in an attack or other scenarios where the outcome should be different
every time the element is called.

Random syntax:

[rand:4|12]

The numbers following rand: define the limits of its range. Even if you want
it to be effectively limitless, you will need to set these values however
you can make them large enough to essentially be limitless:

[rand:0|999999999]
