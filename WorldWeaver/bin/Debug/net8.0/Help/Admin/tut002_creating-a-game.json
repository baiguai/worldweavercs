Before you begin creating games in WorldWeaver (WW) you will want to understand the file structure.
Games are defined within the following directory:

~/GameSources/

!NOTE!
    Everything in WW is case sensitive.
    If you create a folder in GameSources called MyGame users will need to use that case. So they would enter:
    play MyGame

So let's create a new game!

In ~/GameSources

Create a folder called ShadowKeep. This will be the name of our new game. So we now have:

~/GameSources/ShadowKeep

When users run WW they can issue the command:

list games

This will automatically list your game because you created a folder in the ~/GameSources directory.
Next we'll define our game.

!NOTE!
    Everything in WW is an 'element'. Even the game itself is defined as an element.
