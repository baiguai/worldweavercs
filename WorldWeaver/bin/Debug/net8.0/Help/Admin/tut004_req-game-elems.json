There are some events in games that require elements to be defined for them.
For example, when the player dies, WorldWeaver (WW) needs to know what to show the player when this occurs.
Instead of showing them a predefined message WW allows game developers to set this message to whatever they want.
A 'die' message uses this structure:

---

{key=die_message
    output={@
You have died.
    }
}

---

So if we add this to our game element, it now looks like:

---

{key=game
    name=Shadow Keep
    type=game
    parent=root

    {type=enter_message
        output={@
Welcome to Shadow Keep.
        }
    }

    {key=die_message
        output={@
You have died.
        }
    }
}

---

You may have noticed that there is no 'parent' property in the die_message element.
Since it was defined within the game element, WW automatically assigns it the game element key
as its parent.

If we have our game definitions organized differently, so that the die_message is defined in a
different file, or outside the game element, we would need to add a 'parent' property and set
it to 'game' since that is our game's key.

This is true for other elements as well.

We will discuss how to tell the game that the player has died in a future topic.

Now let's define the player.
