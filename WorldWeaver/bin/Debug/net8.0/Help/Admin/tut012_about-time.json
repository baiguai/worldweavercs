As the player plays games in WorldWeaver (WW) time passes by.
Day becomes night, night becomes day.
Days pass by.

Day and night are defined within the WW configuration files. And there
are special functions to allow you to determine if it is day or night.
You can use these to define two different sets of messages to the player.
If they are travelling outside, maybe they get attacked more at night.
Maybe there are certain things that are hidden from view at night.

In WW there are two sets of day counters:

* Total Days
* Mission Days

Total days tracks the number of days that have passed since the player
started playing the game. The mission days tracks how many days they've
been on their current mission.
Missions are something that you can define as the game designer.
You can give the player a mission attribute. And at certain points in the
game, update that attribute, and resetting the mission days to zero.

You can use this logic to limit how long they have to achieve a mission.
Or perhaps certain things begin to happen after X number of days or mission days.

Time can be used in logic blocks, or described in message elements. To access
these values use:

* [isday]
* [totaldays]
* [missiondays]

To update the mission days you can use a set element:

---

{type=set, logic=gamestate(MissionDays)0 }

In an earlier topic we created a room. Now let's add an object to the room.
