Input element types are how you allow the player to interact with your game.
The elements that an element type can process is defined in the configuration files in WorldWeaver.
This allows advanced game developers to modify how WorldWeaver processes their game elements.
For example, by default an 'input' element processes the following element types:

logic
message
set
action
move

These settings are found in:
~/Config/ElementProcRules/ElementByType.json

So as you are building your game, you can use this configuration to inform you of what element types a given
element type will process.

Let's allow the player to look around. In our pub_local location, we'll create a new 'input' element:

{key=local_pub, name=Local Pub, type=room, parent=root
    {type=enter_message
        output={@
You are sitting in your local pub.
        }
    }


    {type=input, syntax=\b(look|l)\b
        {type=action, logic=look, tags=type }
    }
}


You'll notice that there's a child element in our 'input' element. It has a type of 'action', and a tags value of 'type'.
Its logic parameter is set to 'look'. What this means is that if the user enters an input that matches our syntax regex,
the game will fire an element of type 'look'.

So we will want to add an element to our room with a 'look' type.
