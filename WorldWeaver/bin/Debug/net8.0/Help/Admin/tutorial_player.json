Next let's define the player. One thing that sets WorldWeaver apart from other Interactive Fiction engines
is it was designed to create more RPG or video game-style games. Also it is very flexible, you can use the elements
to construct whatever behavior you can imagine. You'll see the RPG influence in the upcomig topics.

Just like the game element we saw in the first tutorial article, there can be only one player element in your game
code.

Let's define a player. To keep things neat and organized, we'll create a new file called player.nrmn. So we now have:
~/GameSources/MyGame/player.nrmn

In this file we'll define an element of type 'player':

{key=player, name=, type=player, parent=local_pub
    ...
}


You'll notice that the name field is left blank. When a player runs your game for the first time, they will be prompted
to set their player name.
The parent field specifies where the player is located.

We will discuss locations in a later step. For now you can use a made up value here - since we won't be playing our game just yet.

So here you can enter the element_key for the starting location.
As the player moves around, this value will change in the database. And if they use 'resume MyGame' instead of 'play MyGame',
they will start in the location they left off in.

A resumed game has the same state the game was in when the player left off.

Let's give our player some Attributes that will further define the player.
