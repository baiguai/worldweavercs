Now let's define the player.
When someone begins to play our game, this definition specifies certain things about the character the
person is playing.
Because WorldWeaver (WW) is designed to be more of a game than a book users can interact with, we can give
our players some stats. To do this we will define some attributes.

I personally like to define my players in their own file. So let's create a file called 'player':

~/GameSources/ShadowKeep/player.nrmn

And here is an example of what a player might look like:

---

{key=player, name=, type=player, parent=local_pub
    {key=player_life, name=Life, type=attribute, output=[rand:8|18], tags=stats }
    {key=player_strength, name=Strength, type=attribute, output=[rand:8|18], tags=stats }
    {key=player_intelligence, name=Intelligence, type=attribute, output=[rand:8|18], tags=stats }
    {key=player_cunning, name=Cunning, type=attribute, output=[rand:8|18], tags=stats }
    {key=player_gold, name=Gold, type=attribute, output=[rand:20|40], tags=stats }
    {key=player_armed, name=Armed Weapon, type=attribute, output=, tags=armed|stats }

    {key=longsword_01, name=Long Sword, type=weapon, syntax=\b(long sword)\b, tags=inventory
        {name=Damage, type=attribute, logic=[rand:4|12], tags=damage }
    }
}

---

You can give your player whatever 'stats' you like. WW allows you to define your own logic,
so you can create all kinds of detailed stats about the player that you can later check when they
perform certain tasks.

You may have noticed the 'stats' tag on these attributes. We will discuss how this is used later in
this tutorial. The same holds true for the weapon and the 'armed' tag.

Also notice the output values in the attribute elements. We will discuss random values in a later
topic as well.

You can see that the player's parent is set to 'local_pub'. This specifies where the player is.
And it refers to the element key of another element. Let's create that element now.
