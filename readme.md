## What is WorldWeaver
WorldWeaver (WW) is an Interactive Fiction engine.
It is designed to let users easily define Interactive Fiction (IF) games that users can play.
It is geared toward RPG style games but more traditional IF games can be built and played as well.

## Why WorldWeaver
WW was built to allow the game author to have **complete** control over their games **AND** to
give them plenty of tools to build a more **RPG** focused game, as opposed to a more traditional
story style IF game.
